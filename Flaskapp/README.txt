A quick Flask Api created to sort through a manually created database. Uses bootstrapper for nav bar and dynamic routing to deal with all inputs
I created this file in vscode with a jupyter enviornment and all files exist under a single folder. e.g. Flask>FavoriteFoods, Templates.
Running this code gives you a local 5000 which you can navigate to in your browser.
